- pretty symlinks for users
- check for free space
- make sure only a single instance is running at a time
- make list command show snapshots as a tree. Maybe optional
- investigate rsync option -y, --fuzzy
- how to deal with oldest snapshot?
  - special prune for highest interval:
    - by free block/inode space
    - option "-keepOldest":
        wether to keep the oldest snapshot (thus being able to go back to the beginning)
        or not, saving disk space.
- what happens when restarting snaprd after a while:
  - it will obsolete many snapshots. This is okay, as long as the deletion will be more conservative
- think about if it is useful to add the full origin path name to the repository subdirs
- regularly log memory stats
- deal with negative time shifts in transComplete()
- fix race condition between goroutines:
  - runner and purger both use FindSnapshots(). This should be done better
  - maybe a finder goroutine?
  - is it possible or needed at all?
- "graceful" subcommand, which will end snaprd after the current purge and/or
  rsync has finished
- when snaprd is initially waiting or getting the groove, the graceful exit
  will block, which should be handled

bugs:

- SIGBUS error!?

- handle errors in RemoveAll (no write permission, what to do?)
