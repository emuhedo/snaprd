- deletion thread
- pretty symlinks for users
- check for free space
- signal handling
  - need to send SIGTERM twice within e. g. 3 seconds in order to quit
    immediately, otherwise quit after finishing all tasks
- make sure only a single instance is running at a time
- make list command show snapshots as a tree. Maybe optional
- investigate rsync option -y, --fuzzy
- fix "latest" link after pruning
- delete obsolete snapshots
- how to deal with oldest snapshot?
- subtract duration of last snapshot from waiting time
- when restarting snaprd after a while, it will obsolete many snapshots.
  This is okay, as long as the deletion will be more conservative
