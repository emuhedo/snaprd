snaprd - backup utility
=======================


Overview
--------

- Continuous creation of snapshots at certain intervals
- Pruning (sieving) snapshots based on fixed schedule, make snapshots more
  scarce the older they get
- Uses rsync to create snapshots
- Every snapshot is a complete copy, using hard links to save disk space
- Designed to run silently in the background
- Repository is designed to be exported via e. g. nfs or smb to enable users to
  do restores of single files or directories

The project homepage is https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/stark/snaprd


Building
--------

Download the archive, unpack and run `make`. Then copy the binary to a
convenient place or run `make install` to place it in /usr/local/bin

OR

Run `go get gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/stark/snaprd`. The binary will be in
`$GOPATH/bin` afterwards.


Installing
----------

Snaprd does not daemonize, logs are printed to the standard output. Choose
whatever you like for starting it at boot: rc.local, SysVinit, upstart,
systemd, supervisord, BSD-init, launchd, daemontools, ...

In case your repository resides in a separate file system you may want to put
some mechanism before startup that makes sure this file system is mounted.


Running
-------

Basic operation:

```
> snaprd run -schedule=shortterm -repository=/target/dir -origin=someserver:some/dir -noWait
2016/09/14 20:32:29 snaprd 1.0 started with pid 50606

Schedules
---------

There are currently two builtin schedules for snapshots which you can choose
with the -schedule switch to the run command:

  - shortterm: 10m 2h 24h 168h 672h
  - longtterm: 6h 24h 168h 672h

The duration listed define how long a snapshot stays in that interval until it
is either promoted to the next higher interval or deleted.

You can define your own schedules by editing a json-formatted file `/etc/snaprd.schedules` with entries like:

```
{
    "production" : [ {"day":1}, {"week":2}, {"month":1}, {"long":1} ],
    "moreoften" : [ {"hour":6}, {"day":1}, {"week":2}, {"month":1}, {"long":1} ]
}
```

The above 'production' schedule will tell snaprd to make a snapshot every day,
keep one of those every 2 weeks, keep one of those every month. The last entry
("long") should not be omitted and basically means eternity.

As many snapshots are kept as "fit" into the next interval.

The 'moreoften' schedule will do almost the same as 'production', but make
snapshots every 6 hours, thus keeping 4 snapshots per day.

You can verify your schedule by running `snaprd scheds`, and later, when
snapshots have already been created, by `snaprd list`.


Testing
-------

To run regression testing, run `make test`

Debug output can be enabled by setting the environment variable SNAPRD_DEBUG=1
